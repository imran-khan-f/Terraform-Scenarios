✅ Scenario 1 — Map of instance types per environment

You have dev, stage, prod environments.
Each environment should use a different instance type from a map.

Example (logic, not code):

dev   → t3.micro
stage → t3.small
prod  → t3.large


Resource must read instance type from the map.

✅ Scenario 2 — Map of AMI IDs per region

You want to deploy EC2 instances in different AWS regions using a map:

Logic:

us-east-1 → ami-1111
us-west-2 → ami-2222
ap-south-1 → ami-3333


EC2 should automatically pick AMI based on the region input.

✅ Scenario 3 — Map of tags applied to a resource

You want to maintain all tags in a single map variable like:

{
  Environment = "dev"
  Owner       = "Imran"
  Project     = "Terraform-Learning"
}


Resource should use tags = var.common_tags.

✅ Scenario 4 — Map for number of servers per environment

Logic:

dev   → 1 server  
stage → 2 servers  
prod  → 4 servers  


Use a map and read count from it.

✅ Scenario 5 — Map of S3 bucket configurations

Store bucket properties inside a map:

{
  dev = {
    versioning = false
    acl = "private"
  }
  prod = {
    versioning = true
    acl = "private"
  }
}
